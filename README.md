# portmidi
* portmidi for PolyML at beginning, but all Portmidi functionalities are at your disposal
* It is a play in progress, this should evolve
* *Now you can use Portmidi without worry of pointers : just use device id or name*
* please read tutor_eng.sml and execute lines step by step for getting started
* use modifier.sml to transform MIDI message from input to output (Presonus Atom SQ -only one channel- )
  this is an example for using read1 and write1 added to lib interface for realtime input-output
* portmidi libs are provided for 64bits : tested on Arch Linux, openSUSE Leap 15.3, Mac Catalina and Windows10 
* *Note : on Ubuntu Studio, timestamp don't work.*
#### Windows users : before using portmidi you have to set portmidi.dll executable => see Wiki
* Click [Wiki](https://github.com/jh-midi/portmidi-sml/wiki) : this is help for installing PolyML on Windows allowing compiling.
