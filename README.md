# portmidi
portmidi for PolyML at beginning, but all Portmidi functionalities are at your disposal<p>
<p> It is a play in progress, this should evolve
## Now you can use Portmidi without worry of pointers : just use device id or name
<ul> please read tutor_eng.sml and execute lines step by step for getting started
<ul> use modifier.sml to transform MIDI message from input to output (example Presonus Atom SQ -only one channel- )
  this is an example for using read1 and write1 added to lib interface for realtime input-output
<ul> portmidi libs are provided for 64bits : tested on Arch Linux, openSUSE Leap 15.3, Mac Catalina and Windows10 
<ul> Note : on Ubuntu Studio, timestamp don't work.
